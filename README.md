Millions of students have a learning, physical, or visual disability that prevents a person from reading conventional print. The majority of educational materials for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields are inaccessible to these students. The goal of this competition is to extract data represented by four types of charts commonly found in STEM textbooks. I developed an automatic solution trained on a graph dataset by fine-tuning a chart derendering visual transformer model called MatCha (Math reasoning and Chart derendering pretraining).
